Recently, I have began to notice how many separate home pages you have to navigate through in order to view different teams and their individual rosters. NHL.com does show alot of the core functionality within this application, however this is designed in a way to more closely organize all of your favorite teams and/or players within the same landscape in a more appUser-friendly experience.

This application is for hockey fans everywhere that have had trouble tracking and organizing their favorite teams/players collectively. This application's purpose is to introduce a more simple way to go about doing so. It can be a hassle to have to go through multiple team pages to see how each team or player is fairing for the season. It can also be overwhelming to look at unnecessary statistics from a ten-year period, as it can be quite confusing where to look. This application can range from the casual fan, who wants to see how their favorite team is doing, to the die-hard who has multiple teams they follow as well as a combination of players for their fantasy team.
